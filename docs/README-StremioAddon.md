# Stremio Addon Extension

The **Stremio Addon Extension** is an **experimental Cloudstream extension** that allows users to add and manage **multiple Stremio stream addon links** directly from the extension settings.

> ⚠️ This extension is experimental and does not provide a full Stremio-like experience.

---

## Features

- Add **unlimited Stremio stream addon links**
- Settings-based management UI
- View all added links in a list
- Delete links at any time
- Saved links are used to load available streaming sources

---

## How It Works

1. The extension provides a **settings screen**
2. Users can:
   - Add new Stremio addon links
   - View all saved links
   - Delete existing links
3. All saved links are used automatically when loading streams

---

## Read This Before Installing ⚠️

- This is **not a full Stremio replacement**
- Streaming depends entirely on the addon
- Catalogue-only addons will:
  - Load metadata
  - Show **“No link found”** during playback
